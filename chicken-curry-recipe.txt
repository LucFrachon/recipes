Chicken Curry

Ingredients (for 4):

 - 600g chicken breast, diced
 - 250ml coconut milk
 - 1 onion
 - 1 garlic clove
 - 1 tbl spoon powedered ginger (or a 2cm dice of fresh ginger, peeled)
 - 2 tbl spoons curry powder
 - 10 pods cardamon
 - 2 bay leaves
 - 150 ml white wine (optional) or water
 - 2 tbl spoons oil (avoid olive oil as it has strong taste)

Thinly chop the onion and garlic. In a frying pan, heat up the oil. 
Add the onion, garlic and spices. Stir well over medium heat.
Once the onion starts to become transluscent, add the chicken breast 
dice and stir again to seal them for 5 minutes.
Add the coconut oil (and wine if required) and reduce heat. Simmer 
for 15 minutes. If the level of liquid becomes to low, top up with
some water. The sauce should cover the chicken but become thicker.

Serve with white rice and a lettuce salad.
